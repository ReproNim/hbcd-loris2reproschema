Since CHILD was born, has there been a time when someone other than you was primarily responsible for providing CHILD with care and support?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[NOTE: This might include times the child was in the care of someone else, or times that you could not care for CHILD for 2 weeks or more, or when things in your life kept you from having time for being CHILD's caregiver. Do NOT include very short periods like a weekend away or a vacation, or periods of time like when you were working -- or had an appointment - so CHILD had daycare, a nanny, or a babysitter."
